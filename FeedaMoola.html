        You might be asking yourself what this part of the website is.
        Look, college isn't cheap. Gas prices are only going up, child support keeps breathing down my neck, and bills keep piling up.
        Most people are too prideful to accept donations/hand-outs. I am most certainly not one of those people.
        The average person under these circumstances would go and get a job, but not I.
        Allow me to introduce you to Feed-A-Moola!

        As you can see, your generosity can go a long way. Some people would say this is a "waste of your money", or "don't give this bum any of your money!".
        Don't listen to those people. Listen to me. I know what's best for you, and that is to donate your money to me.
        If you have more questions about the rates, feel free to email me with your questions and I will respond as soon as possible!
