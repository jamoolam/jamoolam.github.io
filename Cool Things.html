		    <p>Now that you know a bit about me, and some of the work I've done, I guess we can 
           get a bit more personal now. As I mentioned before, I love cooking. If I wasn't 
           the lovechild of two Arab immigrants, I'd have skipped college and went to
           culinary school. Unfortunately, I ended up with a great college education in a 
           thriving field. Terrible, am I right? Anyways, enjoy this photo of a pizza made 
           using only a frying pan.</p>

      <p>I also mentioned that I'm the biggest Miami Heat fan in the world. I fell in love
         with the game of basketball in the year 2013, when my uncle was watching the NBA
         finals matchup between the Spurs and the Heat at a wedding. I was so bored out of
         my mind at said wedding, I just wanted something else to take my attention. It was
         the final quarter of regulation in Game 6. I was so immersed in the game, I couldn't
         believe what I was seeing. Miami down three, LeBron takes a shot. Miss, rebound Bosh
         and back out to Ray Allen, his three pointer, BANG! My 12 year old brain could not 
         process anything that was going on, but I was excited for some reason. That's when I 
         fell in love with the game, with the team. Also, F*** the Lakers.
