        <p>Here are some of the languages I am most familiar with/confident in using.

            <ul>
				<li><b>Java</b></li>

      <p>I have fallen victim to severe cases of Imposter Syndrome, and feeling as though 
		     despite all the time and effort I take into learning, it'll never be enough.
		     Because of that, a lot of my projects are either unfinished or very unpolished. 
		     With some more time and a lot more effort, my portfolio will be a lot more respectable.
		     Some of the other projects I've been working on:</p>
		 <ul>
			  <li><b>Pong</b> - A program coded in Swift using Xcode that is simply a game of 
				pong against a computer opponent, using the keyboard for input</li>
			  <li><b>Intangibles</b> — Mobile Application Takes in data from the surrounding
				environment of the users and sends reminders for things they may 
				not be aware of Examples of reminders would be if the weather is 
				forecasted to have a chance of rain, the app would notify the user 
				to bring an umbrella, among other things</li>
			  <li><b>Bored Games</b> - Allows users to play a plethora of games such as 
				tic-tac-toe or chess against an AI when they are “bored”</li>
			  <li><b>Adventure RPG</b> - This was a project me and a group of classmates made
				for a class in my last semester at SXU. It utilizes a Java GUI with 
				original sprites and an original story (it only simulates a fight against
				an opponent, but has interactable objects and a working battle system 
				equipped with a working health system).</li>
